## A lightweight automatic differentiation engine under construction
# Core engine is zero-dependency. Dev tools (e.g. tests) use NumPy and Jax for comparison only.
This project is an attempt at implementing auto differentiation without additional libraries such as numpy, pytorch, jax etc.
Critical primitive operations including +-*/, exp, log, sin, cos, are allowed for the array and tensor class implemented in the AutoDiff.py file.
